Description: Evaluates the stability of single-cell clusters using bootstrap 
    resampling and co-assignment probability analysis. Cells are repeatedly 
    resampled with replacement and reclustered to measure how consistently 
    they reassemble into the same groups. Works directly with Seurat objects 
    and supports multiple dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, NMF, MNN, etc.).
